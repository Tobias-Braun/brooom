# Brooom architecture

Brooom is a single static Go binary. The CLI is the product; a future
dashboard (`brooom serve`) and agent layer are pure clients of the same core
packages and the same findings schema.

## Principles (non-negotiable)

1. **Safety first.** Every command is a dry run unless `--apply` is given.
   Applying asks for confirmation per group or item unless `--yes`. Nothing
   is ever deleted silently.
2. **Scoped by default.** Without flags only the git repository containing
   the working directory is scanned. `--workspaces` scans every repository and
   project folder below the configured roots. Every path is made absolute,
   symlink-resolved and checked against the allowed locations by
   `scope.Guard`; anything outside is refused.
3. **Detectors find, actions act.** Detectors never modify anything (no file
   writes, no git commands that take locks). Actions consume findings.
4. **Reversible by default.** Files go to the OS trash (or quarantine);
   branches are deleted with `git branch -d` unless `--force`; worktrees are
   removed with `git worktree remove`; git maintenance uses conservative
   expiries. Every applied session writes a manifest for `brooom undo`.
5. **Fast.** Parallel walking, skip lists, cached directory sizes invalidated
   by mtime.

## Packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/brooom` | `main`: calls `cli.Main`. Nothing else. |
| `internal/cli` | Cobra commands, one file per command (`cmd_<name>.go`). Flag parsing, wiring, exit codes. No detection or cleanup logic. |
| `internal/buildinfo` | Version/commit/date via ldflags, fallback to embedded VCS info. |
| `internal/config` | Config types, `Default()`, load/save/validate, per-root overrides, tighten-only `.brooom.json`, `~/.brooom` layout (`BROOOM_HOME` overrides). |
| `internal/scope` | Repo detection, workspace discovery (`[]Target`), `Guard` path validation (symlinks, `..`, case-insensitive filesystems, Windows drive letters/UNC). |
| `internal/walk` | Parallel walker with skip lists, `DirSize` with mtime-invalidated cache in `~/.brooom/cache`. |
| `internal/gitx` | Read-only-safe git runner (`GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, C locale, no prompts) and git helpers (branches, merge detection, worktrees, count-objects). |
| `internal/findings` | **The findings schema** (see [findings.md](findings.md)): `Finding`, `Report`, IDs, risk flags, totals. Stable contract. |
| `internal/detect` | `Detector` interface, registry, `Env`, parallel `Run` engine. |
| `internal/detectors/<name>` | One package per detector, self-registering via `init()`. `internal/detectors/all` blank-imports them. |
| `internal/catalog` | Embedded JSON data: AI tool locations, dev tool log/cache locations, build artifact dirs + project markers. Extensible via config. |
| `internal/action` | `Action` interface, registry, `Executor` (plan → dry run / confirm → apply → manifest → summary). One file per action type. |
| `internal/trash` | `Trasher` interface; OS trash per OS (`trash_windows.go`, `trash_darwin.go`, `trash_unix.go` freedesktop), quarantine, delete. |
| `internal/session` | Session manifests in `~/.brooom/sessions`, listing, undo bookkeeping. |
| `internal/output` | Formatters, one file per format, registered by name. Color/TTY handling helpers. |
| `internal/procs` | "Is this file open by a process?" per OS (best effort, never blocks a scan). |
| `internal/testutil` | Deterministic throwaway git repos and file trees for tests. |

## Contracts

### Detectors (`internal/detect`)

```go
type Detector interface {
    Name() string            // kebab-case, e.g. "merged-branch"
    Description() string
    Category() Category      // git, files, ai, logs, artifacts
    Detect(ctx, env *Env, target scope.Target, emit func(findings.Finding)) error
}
```

Rules:
- Never modify anything. Git calls go through `env.Git` (sanitized env).
- Resolve every emitted path through `env.Guard.Resolve` (or
  `ResolveParent` for symlinks that must not be followed).
- Use `env.Now` and `env.AgeDays` for ages, never `time.Now()`.
- Read thresholds from the effective config for the target.
- Set blocking risk flags honestly; a finding with a blocking flag must
  suggest `ActionNone` and explain why in `SuggestedAction.Reason`.
- Build IDs with `findings.NewID(detector, kind, path, ref)`.
- Evidence codes are stable snake_case; messages are short sentences.
- Return an error only for failures of the whole target; skip unreadable
  entries silently or via evidence.
- `stale-branch` skips branches that `merged-branch` reports (a branch is
  reported once, as merged).

Detector names (config keys, `--detector` values): `stale-branch`,
`merged-branch`, `worktrees`, `git-bloat`, `large-untracked`,
`ai-artifacts`, `log-and-runtime-files`, `build-artifacts`.

### Actions (`internal/action`)

`Plan` re-validates each finding at apply time (re-resolve path, re-stat,
re-check open files / dirty state / new commits) and returns a `Step` or an
`ErrSkipped`-wrapped reason; `findings.Actionable(flags, force)` decides
whether risk flags allow acting. `Apply` returns a `session.Entry` with undo
information. `Undo` reverses an entry where possible. The `Executor` owns
confirmation, manifests and the summary; individual actions never prompt.

### Trash (`internal/trash`)

`Remove(path) (Record, error)` / `Restore(Record)`. Never follows symlinks.
Cross-device moves fall back to copy + verify + delete. Windows locked files
produce a clear error naming the file.

The OS trash is selected per platform by `newOSTrasher` in
`ostrash_unix.go` (freedesktop), `ostrash_darwin.go` and
`ostrash_windows.go`; quarantine and delete live in `quarantine.go` and
`delete.go`, so the platform implementations never touch each other's files.

### Open files (`internal/procs`)

`procs.OpenFiles(ctx, paths)` reports which paths (or directories with an
open file below them) are open by a process. Best effort with a bounded
timeout (`DefaultTimeout` when the context has no deadline). `ErrUnavailable`
and `ErrIncomplete` (partial map still returned, `true` entries reliable) mean
unknown for `false` entries, never "safe". Per OS: `/proc/<pid>/fd` on Linux,
`lsof` on macOS, Restart Manager on Windows.

### Output (`internal/output`)

`Formatter.Write(w, *findings.Report, Options)`. `json` is the `Report` as
is; `ndjson` is one `Finding` per line; `plain` is paths only (for branches:
`<repo>\t<branch>`), one per line. Formats never write ANSI codes when
`Options.Color` is false.

## Configuration

`~/.brooom/config.json` (override the home with `BROOOM_HOME`). Every field
has a default in `config.Default()`, so the file only contains overrides.
Layout of `~/.brooom`:

```
config.json
cache/        scan cache (safe to delete)
sessions/     <session-id>.json manifests
quarantine/   <session-id>/... quarantined files
```

Per-root overrides live in `roots[].thresholds` / `roots[].detectors`. A
repository may contain `.brooom.json` that can only tighten rules (disable
detectors, raise thresholds, add protected branches and excludes).

## Conventions

- Go 1.24, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, no runtime dependencies. Keep third-party
  dependencies minimal (cobra, golang.org/x/sys, golang.org/x/term).
- Cross-platform: use `filepath`, never hard-code `/`; OS-specific code in
  `_windows.go` / `_darwin.go` / `_unix.go` files with build tags as needed;
  every package must build for linux, darwin and windows on amd64 and arm64.
- Tests: table-driven, `t.TempDir()`, `testutil.NewRepo` for git. Tests must
  pass on Linux, macOS and Windows (CI runs all three). Never touch the real
  home directory: set `BROOOM_HOME` / `HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` to temp dirs.
- Errors: wrap with context (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`), name the path.
- Comments explain *why*; doc comments on every exported identifier.
- Functions stay below cyclomatic complexity 15 (`gocyclo`).
- `go vet`, `golangci-lint run` and `go test ./...` must pass before a PR.

## Exit codes

`0` success, `1` error, `2` usage error.
